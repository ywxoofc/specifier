Hi! Iâ€™m a Roblox exploit;script developer, and I run a server called "ywxoscripts". I focus on games that donâ€™t have many scripts available for exploits.

At first, this was just something I did for fun. But over the last four years, it became a real hobby. 

I taught myself how to use Lua with a few tutorial videos. Those videos probably arenâ€™t very helpful today, but they worked for me back then.

Recently, I also started learning GUI design. And honestly, the designs Iâ€™ve made so far look kinda good (if I do say so myself!).

Want to see more updates and announcements about my scripts?
